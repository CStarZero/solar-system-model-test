# solar-system-model-test
A test model for a solar system using Newtonian physics, within Unreal engine v5. 
The simulation takes into account the gravitational interactions between the major planets, resulting in a more accurate representation of their movements over time. However, this is still a simplified model. Factors such as orbital eccentricity, inclination, and perturbations from other celestial bodies are not included at this time, but planned for future tests.
